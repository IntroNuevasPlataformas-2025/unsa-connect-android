// The top-level functions `getHighlightedNews` and `getRecentNews` that were previously in this file
// have been deprecated. Their logic has been moved into `FakeNewsRepository.kt`,
// which implements the `NewsRepository` interface from the domain layer.
// This change was made to follow a more structured and scalable repository pattern.
